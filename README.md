# Vendor Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project evaluates vendor performance and inventory efficiency in a retail/wholesale setting. It identifies underperforming brands, quantifies vendor contributions to sales and profit, measures the impact of bulk purchasing, flags slow-moving inventory, and statistically compares profitability models across vendor groups.

**Core business questions**
- Which vendors/brands are underperforming and need pricing or promotional adjustments?
- Who are the top vendors by sales and profitability?
- How much do bulk purchases reduce unit costs?
- Which vendors contribute to unsold inventory and poor stock turnover?
- Are there statistically significant differences between high- and low-performing vendors?

## 🧾 Business Context
Companies risk margin erosion due to inefficient pricing, low inventory turnover, over-reliance on a few vendors, and obsolete stock. This repo provides a data-driven approach to mitigate these risks and improve decision-making.

```

## 🔍 Key Findings (high level)
- **Underperforming Brands**: ~198 brands show low sales but high margins → candidates for targeted promos / price optimization.
- **Vendor Concentration Risk**: Top 10 vendors ≈ 66% of purchases → diversify to reduce supply chain risk.
- **Bulk Purchasing**: Large orders achieve ≈ 72% lower unit costs → supports bulk-buy strategy.
- **Inventory Exposure**: ≈ $2.71M tied up in unsold inventory → optimize purchase quantities/clearances.
- **Profitability Models Differ**: High-margin vendors vs. top-selling vendors differ significantly (hypothesis test rejects H₀).

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib/seaborn for EDA and modeling
- **SQLite**: lightweight DB for ingestion & analysis
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: reproducible analysis
- **Power BI**: interactive stakeholder-ready dashboards

## 🚀 Reproduce Locally
1. **Clone**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-name>
   ```
2. **Set up environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Ingest data into SQLite**
   - Place CSVs in `./data/` (or ensure `vendor_sales_summary.csv` is present if you only want to explore outputs).
   - Run:
     ```bash
     python ingestion_db.py
     ```
   - This creates `inventory.db` and loads each CSV as a table (table name = filename without `.csv`).
4. **Build vendor summary table**
   ```bash
   python get_vendor_summary.py
   ```
   - Creates/overwrites `vendor_sales_summary` in `inventory.db` with computed KPIs (GrossProfit, ProfitMargin, StockTurnover, etc.).
5. **Explore notebooks**
   - Open `Exploratory Data Analysis.ipynb` and `Vendor Performance Analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter to replicate the analysis.
6. **Open dashboard**
   - Open `vendor_performance.pbix` with Power BI Desktop to interact with the visuals.

## 🧮 Key KPIs (computed in `get_vendor_summary.py`)
- **GrossProfit** = TotalSalesDollars − TotalPurchaseDollars  
- **ProfitMargin** = (GrossProfit / TotalSalesDollars) × 100  
- **StockTurnover** = TotalSalesQuantity / TotalPurchaseQuantity  
- **SalesToPurchaseRatio** = TotalSalesDollars / TotalPurchaseDollars  

## 🧠 Methodology Notes
- Robust EDA to identify outliers, zero/negative margins, and slow movers.
- Data cleaning with safe divisions and NA handling.
- Correlation analysis to understand price vs. sales/profit dynamics.
- Hypothesis testing to validate profitability differences.

## ✅ Recommendations (business-facing)
- Re-price and promote **low-sales, high-margin** brands to grow volume.
- **Diversify vendors** to reduce supply-chain concentration risk.
- Use **bulk purchase** levers where feasible to maintain a cost advantage.
- **Liquidate or right-size** slow-moving inventory to free working capital.
- Improve marketing/distribution for low-performing vendors to lift sales without margin damage.

## 🗂️ Credits & Files to Review First
- Start with **Vendor Performance Report.pdf** for an executive read.
- Then scan **Vendor Performance Analysis.ipynb** for the analytical backbone.
- `get_vendor_summary.py` shows the KPI computations used throughout.
